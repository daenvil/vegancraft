# Daenvil's Vegancraft
A datapack/collection of datapacks which makes a vegan gamestyle possible in a vanilla-like way without missing any game features.

You can either download the full collection in a single datapack or [download the individual datapacks as desired](#features).

### Ethical Textiles

Plant-based alternatives for string, leather, and beds. Use together with _Acacia Gum_ to have fully vegan leather.

### Resourcepack

Most of these datapacks contain custom textures and item names. The Vegancraft resourcepack is needed in order to view them properly. For simplicity, this resourcepack is the same for all datapacks, and is available on the [Downloads](#full-datapack-download) section or in the PlanetMinecraft page of any single datapack that uses it.

### Customization options

- **These individual datapacks are entirely modular**, meaning that if you don't like one (or more) of them, you can just download all the rest of them without worrying about compatibility issues. The "full" datapack (downloadable at the top of the page) is just an optimized merged version of all of these datapacks.

- As detailed on the individual datapacks, some features, such as custom advancements or XP rewards for crafting vegan items, can be disabled by using the command "**/function dnv.vegancraft:toggle**". You can also use that command to turn them on again. This allows to play in an even more vanilla way, if desired.

## Future Features
Planned datapacks that are still in progress

### Plant Wax

Get wax from some plants, like in real life. A vegan alternative for honeycomb.

### Copper horns

Craft horns using copper and wax.
