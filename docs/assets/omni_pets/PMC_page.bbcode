[h2]Summary[/h2]
This datapack allows you to tame wolves and cats using any food.

[b][i]Throw[/i] food at stray cats or wolves to attempt to tame them[/b]. They will eat any food thrown by players if they are close enough to it.
[list]
[*]Wolves will react the same way as if you just gave them a bone (1/3 chance of being tamed).[/*]
[*]Cats are picky eaters, so food consumed this way will only have a 20% chance of taming them.[/*]
[/list]

[h2]Accepted foods[/h2]
Basically any food that can be eaten by you -except chocolate cookies- and some others which make sense for animals to eat, like sugar cane and mushrooms.
