Alternatively, use hay bales instead of wheat to produce seitan more efficiently:

[h4]Not-fish fillet[/h4]
Crafted with a (seitan) steak and 3 kelp. [i]Behaves as raw cod (so you can attract cats with it and tame them)[/i].

*[style b color=#e74c3c]WARNING[/style]: due to the way I coded the recipes, sometimes the output will show the actual vanilla item instead of the knowledge book. If you want the custom item name and texture, just [b]change the position of any ingredient and the output will change to the knowledge book[/b]. I decided to do it this way so the recipes show up in the in-game recipe book, instead of having to memorize them.

[h2]Custom textures[/h2]
Each of the new food items has its own texture. Here they are compared to their vanilla counterparts:

The [b]Vegancraft Resourcepack[/b] (download above) is required to see these textures in-game.

[spoiler=Vegancraft features]This is a standalone datapack, but it is designed as a part of [style b color=#27ae60]Vegancraft[/style], a (work in progress) collection of datapacks with the goal of making a vegan gamestyle possible in a vanilla-like way without missing any game features.

As part of its integration on Vegancraft, this datapack includes the following additional features:

- [b]A custom advancement tree[/b].

- [b]Vegan ingredients detection[/b]: since you can craft cakes with cow milk and not-fish fillets with cow meat, the datapack will try to determine if you are using vegan ingredients or not when crafting these items, labelling them if they are not vegan. Vegan and non-vegan items do not stack.

- [b]Cats and wolves tamed with vegan food will have a green collar by default[/b], instead of the usual red (check out my **[​Omnivorous Pets]** datapack (*to be released*) if you want to tame wolves and cats with more kinds of foods).

- [b]Some xp will be awarded when crafting seitan steaks and not-fish fillets[/b]. The amount of xp is equivalent to that you would get by getting those items the "regular" way (breeding and killing cows/fishing cod).

[b]If, for any reason, you want to remove these features, you can use the command "[color=#18a085]/function dnv.vegancraft:toggle[/color]" to disable them. [/b]You can also use that command to turn them on again.[/spoiler]
[spoiler=Reasoning for the recipes]- All of the plant milk recipes are based on real plant-based milks (the sunflower representing sunflower seeds).

- The egg replacements -wheat and potato- represent wheat and potato starch, respectively, both used in real-life egg-free baking.

- Flower honey represents a kind of vegan honey that can be made by boiling flowers in water. Apple honey represents apple syrup, and there are also some recipes for vegan honey made from apple syrup or juice.

- Seitan is made by soaking wheat flour in water and filtering it. The stew/soup represents a marinade to give the seitan steak flavour.

- Not-fish fillet is based on real recipes for "vegan fish", although in real life it is more common to use tofu for this.[/spoiler]
[spoiler=Notes for developers]If you are creating a datapack that adds custom food and you want your custom food to be recognized by this datapack, just do the following:
- If it is a vegan food retexturing a non-vegan food item, just include the tag "[color=#18a085]dnv.Vegan:1b[/color]" in the NBT tags of the item.
- If it is a non-vegan food retexturing a vegan food item, just include the tag "[color=#18a085]dnv.Vegan:0b[/color]" in the NBT tags of the item.[/spoiler]
